The experience was both intriguing and ultimately fulfilling, yet it proved to be more time-consuming than I initially anticipated for a two-week project. 
The learning curve was steep, particularly because of my limited experience, and I encountered numerous challenges that required trial and error to overcome. 
In hindsight, I realize that having either more time for the assignment or a smaller scope would have allowed me to refine the project further and produce a higher-quality outcome.
